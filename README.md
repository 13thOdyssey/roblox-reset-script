# roblox-reset-keybind-script
How this is used
1: To use this, you must have a script executor. Any of them are fine, just make sure you have one, as that's pretty much the only way to use it (SS executors should work too, that's optional.
You just press the keyboard character in whatever game your executor is injected in, and it should automatically kill your Roblox character.
I suggest you don't make the keybind something you normally press all the time, just some other key, like x, for example as it's the closest to what your unoccupied finger area is in, while moving your avatar with W,A,S,D.
There is a wait time of 2 seconds for the script to load

have fun, this script is also helpful in the streets, so some annoying kid won't be able to KO you and drag you all the way to the van or whatever i dont even play the
